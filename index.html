            <strong>The Yellow Journal</strong> is UVA's oldest—and only—secret satire publication.
            Since its inception in 1912 A.D., the Yellow Journal's name has struck fear into the hearts of hapless
            administrators, humorless students, and anyone else unfortunate enough to draw the ire of our wicked pen.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>
            The Yellow Journal ... [is] scurrilous and indecent in the extreme.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="attribution">— UVA Administrative Council, 1934</p>
        <blockquote>
            ...a delicate and dangerous mixture of existential whining [and] sexual repression.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="attribution">— <i>Spy Magazine</i>, 1991</p>
        <blockquote>
            The editors were diabolically cunning. People tolerated The Yellow Journal with good humor that occasionally
            turned to anger, for people were terrified of appearing in it.
